# ICE-Dashboard-2022-2023
## Internship Project at ICE Data Services, Hyderabad

The aim of this project was to develop a dynamic dashboard that represents the Social Corporate Responsibility (CSR) project of ICE Data Services, which is carried out in collaboration with the AIF (American Indian Foundation). The CSR project focuses on teaching fintech to students across 30 different schools located in five different cities across two states. A total of 29 fintech sessions were planned to be completed in these schools.

The project cities include Hyderabad, Rangareddy, Guntur, Bapatla, and Palnadu in the states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. The dashboard provides various permutations and combinations of data to effectively analyze the project's progress. It consists of two pages, where the first page offers a district-wise comparison, while the second page provides a school-wise comparison.

The primary data for the project was initially provided in Excel sheets, which were then loaded, transformed, and modeled using power query in Google Sheets. The stakeholders and the team lead were highly satisfied with the work. The dashboard provided valuable insights into the current stage of the project, identified drawbacks, and assisted in future planning for the project's success.
